        <h1>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</h1>


        <h2>What went well</h2>
        <p>The week went smoothly since I had created/refined my sprint schedule, it was easier to manage my tasks and do them as well. </p>

        <h2>What can be improved/What lessons have you learnt?</h2>
        <p>Doing a survey on 3-4 people wasnt really the best idea but it was a good experiment for some knowledge to do it on a lot of people. Also my ideation process could be improved since i didnt really finalise any ideas and just put them in the WIP presentations.</p>

        <h2>What actions will I take for the next sprint.</h2>
        <p>Make sure to properly structure my process so its easier to remember and show to others for better feedback.</p>
