        <h1>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</h1>


        <h2>What went well</h2>
        <p>A process that went well this week was that I knew what to do with the given tasks by the lectures. Creating git repositories and deploying netlify sites were a cool process and I felt like a Ui/Ux designer. The bootcamp sites were simple and fun and the Agile/ideation lectures were helpful for creating new ideas.</p>

        <h2>What can be improved/What lessons have you learnt?</h2>
        <p>One thing that could be improved is definetly time management since the first 2-3 days of the term, I wasnt really focused on work and instead played Monster Hunter Wilds and hit the gym. I learnt now that I should really plan out the term better and set goals for myself each day instead of doing it all on Friday. This can help me complete deadlines in time as well as general production.</p>

        <h2>What actions will I take for the next sprint.</h2>
        <p>I will start adding notes on my figjam on what to complete next and start putting at least 1 hours of work each day. If i am unsure i will try to message/book mentoring earlier to help with tasks im not sure of.</p>
